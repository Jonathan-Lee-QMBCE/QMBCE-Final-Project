The BBS DATA, Temperature data, and Route Locations data should all be downloaded and placed in their respective folders (details for each can be found in their respective folders).

For the NLCD land cover, create a folder for the year you would like to study, create a folder within that named "landcover", and extract the contents of the NLCD file downloaded to that location. For example, 2016's land cover would result in:

2016/
     landcover/
               NLCD_16_LC.rrd
               NLCD_16_LC.xml
               NLCD_16_LC.rde
               NLCD_16_LC.img
               NLCD_16_LC.ige

(the cover data can be downloaded from https://www.mrlc.gov/data?f%5B0%5D=category%3ALand%20Cover&f%5B1%5D=region%3Aconus)
